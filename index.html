	    <p id="old-ogiso" class="substep">Around 1000s, society was <em>hierarchical. </em></p>

	    <p id="old-uzama" class="substep">And the king was assisted by the <b>Uzamas</b> <i>(powerful nobles)</i>.</p>

	    <h1>Social Organisation </h1>
	    <p>The basic organising principle within both the village and the urban ward is the division of the population into age sets.</p>
	    <p>Pre Colonial Benin society had a clearly demarcated class structure: a mostly urban elite, comprising the governmental, religious, and educational bureaucracies; a commoner group, consisting of lower-status urbanites, such as artisans; and the peasantry.</p>
	    <p>Formerly, the king and chiefs had slaves, primarily acquired through warfare, who constituted an agricultural workforce for the elite.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="political-organisation" class="step slide" data-scale="0.5" data-rel-x="800" data-rel-y="0" data-rel-z="0">
	    <h1>Political Organisation </h1>
	    <p>The Oba's mother was a title holder (iyoba) in one of the palace societies and maintained her own court near Benin City, and his younger brothers were sent to be hereditary chiefs of villages throughout the kingdom, thus constituting part of a limited, rural-based elite. </p>
	    <p>Besides the king and his family, the political structure consisted of the holders of various chiefly titles, who were organised into three main orders of chiefs: the seven uzama , the palace chiefs, and the town chiefs.</p>
	    <p>-Each unit of Benin was controlled by a title holder who acted as the intermediary between the villages and the king and whose main duty was to collect taxes and tribute in the form of money (cowries) and goods (cattle, yams etc). </p>
